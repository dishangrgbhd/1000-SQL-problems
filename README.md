## SOLVING 1000+ SQL PROBLEMS
Here I am trying to keep up my problem solving ability and maintain my cognitive abilities too by solving different SQL questions from a book by the Zero Analyst. The problems will be categorized on the basis of difficulty levels and also various company-wise(interview questions).
I will try my best to solve problems consistently.
